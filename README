This Github page has been created as a means of documenting and sharing my professional development. 

It showcases several labs, papers, and experiments from varying classes located in the School directory, each divided by the class they were performed in.

Aside from school work, it also showcases personal programming projects I have taken on to better my understanding. ProjectEuler and CodeForces both contain word problems that must be solved using programming.

My resume is attached directly to the master directory, and more information can be obtained about my professional carrer at my LinkedIn page:
